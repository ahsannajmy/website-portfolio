    I recently received my bachelor's degree in computer science. 
    I have the motivation to work in the technology field, specifically 
    in the data analyst field, and I'm also expanding my expertise in 
    backend development. I have a high level of curiosity and feel challenged 
    if given a problem involving data. In this field, I have significant 
    interest in a data analyst or data scientist position. In addition 
    to my data analysis projects and courses, I am also learning backend 
    technologies in multiple programming languages both in my university 
    and outside university through courses. For supporting my interest, 
    I have taken several courses related to both data analyst and backend development roles.
